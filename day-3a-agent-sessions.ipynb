Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas for AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key new developments and ongoing trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is perhaps the most prominent area. AI models, particularly **generative adversarial networks (GANs)** and **variational autoencoders (VAEs)**, are being trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They can then generate entirely new molecular structures with desired characteristics (e.g., binding affinity to a specific target, low toxicity).\n    *   **Examples:** Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **Atomwise**, and **Schrödinger** are heavily invested in this, reporting the design of novel drug candidates for various diseases.\n*   **Optimizing Existing Leads:** Generative AI isn't just for creating brand new molecules.

AI for Predicting Drug Properties and Efficacy:**\n\n*   **Property Prediction Models:** AI is incredibly good at learning complex relationships. Models are being developed to predict:\n    *   **ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity):** This is crucial for understanding how a drug will behave in the body and whether it's likely to be toxic. Early prediction can save immense time and resources by weeding out problematic candidates.\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** Predicting how strongly a drug candidate will bind to its intended biological target.\n    *   **Solubility and Stability:** Important factors for drug formulation and shelf life.\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can screen millions of potential compounds virtually, identifying the most promising ones to then test experimentally.\n\n**3. AI in Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Genomics and Proteomics Analysis:** AI can sift through massive amounts of genomic, proteomic, and other 'omics' data to identify novel biological targets that play a role in disease. This helps researchers understand the underlying mechanisms of disease and find new points of intervention.\n    *   **Example:** Identifying specific genes or proteins that are overexpressed or mutated in cancer cells.\n*   **Network Biology:** AI can map complex biological networks to understand how different components interact and how a disease disrupts these systems, revealing potential drug targets.\n\n**4. AI for Accelerating Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict a patient's response to a drug, allowing for more precise patient selection in clinical trials.\n*   **Clinical Trial Design Optimization:** AI can help design more efficient clinical trials by predicting success rates, optimizing dosage regimens, and identifying potential risks.\n*   **Analyzing Trial Data:** AI can analyze vast amounts of data generated during trials to identify patterns, predict outcomes, and monitor patient safety more effectively.\n\n**5. LLMs and their Role in Drug Discovery:**\n\n*   **Literature Review and Hypothesis Generation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are proving invaluable for sifting through the ever-growing body of scientific literature. They can summarize research, identify gaps in knowledge, and even help researchers formulate new hypotheses.\n*   **Knowledge Graph Construction:** LLMs can help build comprehensive knowledge graphs that link drugs, targets, diseases, and biological pathways, providing a more interconnected understanding of the drug discovery landscape.\n*   **Synthesizing Information for Researchers:** LLMs can act as intelligent assistants, helping researchers quickly access and synthesize information relevant to their specific research questions.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **Biotech Startups:** A significant number of innovative startups are leveraging AI for drug discovery, often focusing on specific disease areas or therapeutic modalities.\n*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with AI-focused biotech firms or investing in their own internal AI capabilities.\n*   **Focus on Undruggable Targets:** AI is opening up possibilities for tackling diseases that were previously considered \"undruggable\" due to the complexity of their targets.\n*   **Accelerated Timelines:** The ultimate goal is to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new drug to market, which currently averages over a decade and billions of dollars.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advances, challenges persist, including the need for high-quality, diverse datasets, robust validation of AI predictions, and seamless integration of AI tools into existing R&D workflows.\n\nIn essence, AI is revolutionizing drug discovery by making it more data-driven, predictive, and efficient, moving from a largely empirical process to a more intelligent and targeted approach.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **AI for Predicting Drug Properties and Efficacy**. This is a critical area that addresses some of the biggest bottlenecks in traditional drug discovery.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this entails and why it's so important:\n\n**What it Means:**\n\nInstead of synthesizing and experimentally testing thousands or millions of compounds to see if they work and are safe, AI models are trained to predict these properties *in silico* (using computer simulations). The goal is to build a virtual screening system that can accurately forecast how a potential drug will behave before it ever reaches a lab bench.\n\n**Key Properties AI Models Predict:**\n\n1.  **ADMET Properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity):** This is arguably the most crucial aspect.\n    *   **Absorption:** How well will the drug be absorbed into the bloodstream (e.g., orally, through injection)?\n    *   **Distribution:** Where will the drug go in the body? Will it reach the target organ or tissue? Will it accumulate in unwanted places?\n    *   **Metabolism:** How will the body break down the drug? Will it be metabolized into active or toxic byproducts?\n    *   **Excretion:** How will the drug and its metabolites be eliminated from the body?\n    *   **Toxicity:** This is a broad category. AI can predict various types of toxicity, including:\n        *   **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)**\n        *   **Cardiotoxicity (heart damage)**\n        *   **Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)**\n        *   **Genotoxicity (damage to DNA)**\n        *   **Carcinogenicity (cancer-causing potential)**\n        *   **Off-target effects:** Will the drug bind to unintended biological molecules, leading to side effects?\n\n2.  **Binding Affinity to Target:** How strongly will the drug molecule bind to its intended biological target (e.g., a specific protein receptor, enzyme). Higher affinity often correlates with greater efficacy.\n\n3.  **Physicochemical Properties:**\n    *   **Solubility:** How well does the drug dissolve? This is important for formulation and absorption.\n    *   **Lipophilicity (LogP):** A measure of how \"fat-loving\" a molecule is, impacting its ability to cross cell membranes.\n    *   **Stability:** How stable is the molecule under various conditions (e.g., temperature, pH)?\n\n4.  **Efficacy at the Target:** Beyond just binding, AI can also try to predict how well the drug will modulate the function of its target (e.g., activate or inhibit it).\n\n**Why is this Development So Important?**\n\n*   **Massive Time and Cost Savings:**\n    *   **Reduces Experimental Burden:** Traditional drug discovery involves extensive, time-consuming, and expensive laboratory experiments for synthesis and testing. AI prediction drastically reduces the number of compounds that need to be physically synthesized and tested.\n    *   **De-risking Early:** Identifying potential toxicity or poor absorption early in the process prevents investing further resources into compounds that are doomed to fail later on.\n*   **Increased Success Rates:** By filtering out compounds with unfavorable properties early, AI helps researchers focus on candidates that have a higher probability of success in later pre-clinical and clinical stages.\n*   **Accelerated Timelines:** When you're not waiting for lengthy experiments or dealing with late-stage failures, the overall drug discovery timeline shrinks.\n*   **Discovery of Novel Chemical Space:** AI can explore chemical structures that human intuition might not consider, potentially leading to the discovery of entirely new classes of drugs.\n*   **Precision Medicine Applications:** By predicting how a drug might behave in specific biological contexts, AI can contribute to developing more personalized therapies.\n\n**How it Works (Simplified):**\n\nThese AI models are typically **machine learning models** (often deep learning models like neural networks). They are trained on massive datasets containing:\n\n*   **Chemical Structures:** Representations of molecules.\n*   **Experimental Data:** Known ADMET properties, binding affinities, efficacies, etc., for a large number of compounds.\n\nThe AI learns to identify patterns and correlations between the chemical structure of a molecule and its resulting properties. Once trained, it can take a novel chemical structure and predict its properties based on what it has learned.\n\n**Examples of AI Models Used:**\n\n*   **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models:** Traditional QSAR models use statistical methods to relate chemical structure to biological activity. AI-powered QSAR goes further, using more complex algorithms.\n*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** These are particularly well-suited for molecular data as molecules can be represented as graphs (atoms are nodes, bonds are edges).\n*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers:** Can be used to process molecular sequences (e.g., SMILES strings).\n\nIn summary, the ability of AI to accurately predict drug properties and efficacy is a game-changer, allowing for a more efficient, cost-effective, and ultimately successful path to developing new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI for predicting drug properties and efficacy is quite dynamic, with a mix of established pharmaceutical giants, specialized AI drug discovery startups, and tech companies.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
